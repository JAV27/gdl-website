The Grassroots Development League (GDL) was founded by a group of visionary industry professionals, 
with significant experience in the youth soccer marketplace. Through utilization of a brand new 
technology platform, designed and adapted to focus on the education of players, coaches and 
parents, the GDL absorbs the administration requirements associated with operating a league 
style program. The foundation of the GDL concept was built around recognition of the absence of 
an organized, development focussed program that supplements the vast array of training 
opportunities that currently exist for U7/U8 players. The deliberate inclusive nature of the 
program creates a diverse competitive platform for players and teams from all walks of life. 
The player centric design of the program creates a fun, safe and engaging atmosphere that is 
driven by development versus results.
