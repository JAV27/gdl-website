The Grassroots Development League (GDL) was created to provide a developmentally appropriate, supplemental opportunity for motivated young soccer players. Introducing the concept of competition and exposing teams to outside groups for the first time, in a controlled and low pressure environment, makes the GDL a perfect stepping stone for teams as they prepare for their transition into more organized and structured play at u9.

Supported by a unique software platform, the GDL is a fun, engaging, and safe program that adheres to US Soccer recommendations with regards to format and structure.
