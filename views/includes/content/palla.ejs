In addition to the TapIn Mobile Solutions partnership, Grassroots Development League 
has partnered with Palla Sportswear to bring the game to deserving children. As the 
exclusive sportswear brand of the GDL, Palla will donate products to players and teams 
playing in TapIn leagues around the world each time a GDL player, parent, referee, or 
coach buys Palla products. By shopping at Pallasport.com, every item you purchase will 
result in a similar item being donated to a child or team playing in a TapIn developing 
nation league. Buy a ball they give a ball. Buy a pair of shin guards, they give a pair. 
Itâ€™s that simple.

The GDL specifically chose Palla as its partner brand because of our shared values, which 
they articulate perfectly in their mission
