Today, the Grassroots Development League (www.gdlsoccer.com), a Greenfield, LLC company, announced a comprehensive long-term partnership agreement with social impact soccer brand, Palla Sportswear. Through the agreement, Palla Sportswear will become the official sportswear and equipment provider for all GDL leagues. As part of the deal terms, every newly registered GDL player will receive a Palla ball and a pair of shin guards at no additional charge. In addition, all GDL players, families, coaches, and referees will automatically receive discounted pricing on all Palla products sold through the Palla storefront at www.pallasport.com.

“This is an exciting development for us at GDL”, said GDL CEO, James Hamblin. “We wanted to work with a brand that not only produces great soccer products at fair prices, but a brand that shares our values around positive social impact. The Palla team has players, coaches, and refs at top of mind with everything they do, and they are committed to playing a big part in making the game more accessible to less advantaged communities”.

Palla director, Steve Prince, also expressed excitement about the new partnership. “Palla is relatively new to the North American market, so we are thrilled to have the opportunity to showcase our quality to new young players and families through our partnership with GDL. Aligning ourselves with forward thinking soccer leaders like GDL fits perfectly into our plans to become a leading soccer brand in North America in future years”.
