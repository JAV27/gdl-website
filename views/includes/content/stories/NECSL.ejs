The GDL begins programming with their festival style events in the Spring 2021. Providing an innovative and fun program that compliments what clubs, towns and others are doing with 1st and 2nd grade players makes the GDL uniquely positioned to provide a distinctive developmental experience to players throughout New England. The collaboration with the NECSL will see the two organizations work together to provide a first class experience for all participants, with NECSL members playing at a discounted rate in the OPEN TO ALL program. 
"The GDL is commited to partnering with  progressive, player development-focused organizations. This makes the NECSL a perfect partner for us. Collaborating with one of the most forward-thinking leagues in the northeast creates a unique opportunity for the GDL to bring supplemental programming options to u7 and u8 players throughout New England. The GDL is excited about providing a distinctive developmental experience to the NECSL member clubs, as well as other like-minded clubs and organizations across the region." -Justin  Capell. 
The NECSL will introduce the GDL at the foundation level of their pathway, providing their member clubs an opportunity to enhance the developmental experience of their u7 and u8 players by adding an engaging and diverse option. 


"The NECSL looks to partner with the best in class organizations. As a league, we aspire to improve and evolve each session to ensure our clubs, teams, players, and families have a first-class experience. In addition, we believe in win/win relationships. It is important for our partners to reflect well on the NECSL and for the NECSL to reflect well on our partners. We believe the relationship with the GDL meets these two importnat criteria when evaluating partnerships." -Sean Carey
