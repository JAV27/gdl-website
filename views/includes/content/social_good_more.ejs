In addition to being a best-in-class league management platform, TapIn’s mission aims to 
highlight how development of business in emerging nations can both drive shareholder value, 
and focus on social good. The TapIn team is comprised of entrepreneurs, venture investors, 
fortune 500 executives and representatives from prominent non-profits focusing on health and 
disease management and detection and education as well as soccer infrastructure projects in 
the developing world. The GDL is proud to partner with an organization that is all about 
growing the game for those less advantaged both here at home and around the world.

As part of our multifaceted partnership, every time a player registers in a GDL league program 
in North America, a child in a TapIn League in Haiti, Jamaica, Uganda (and more coming!) is
 automatically registered to play in their country league at no charge. That’s right….register 
 your son or daughter to play, and you are automatically registering a deserving child in a 
 developing nation!
